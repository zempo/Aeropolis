## Disclaimer About Air Quality Calculations 

There is an ongoing debate over the inconsistencies in determining a city's Air Quality Index. For example, the transition between air quality health levels is considered somewhat "abrupt" by a number of atmospheric chemists, geologists, and meterologists. In an attempt to mitigate this issue, more levels have been added to the health scale in this project. That said, until more standardized measurement of air-quality emerges, the United State Air Quality Index will be used for this project. Thus, this project is NOT intended for research/academic purposes.
